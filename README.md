# Building an Inverse Image Search Service
___

Exploration and implementation of an inverse image search using transfer learning and nearest neighbors search.

This project draws inspiration from the lessons present in Deep Learning Cookbook by Douwe Osinga (O'Reilly), Copyright 2018 Douwe Osinga, 978-1-491-99584-6.

## Getting started

First, you'll need `conda`. Then, create the environment with the following command:

```
conda create -n inverse-image-search python=3.6
```

Activate the environment:

```
source activate inverse-image-search
```

Finally, install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Interact with the notebooks

Once in the conda environment, run:

```
jupyter notebook
```
